======================================

Contents:
- index.html
- privacy.html
- feedback.html
- css/styles.css
- CNAME

How to deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private).
2. Upload the files from this folder to the repository root (or push from your local machine).
3. In the repository settings -> Pages, choose the branch (main) and folder (root) and save.
4. Add the custom domain `asios.tech` in Pages settings (or let the CNAME file handle it).
5. Make sure DNS A/ALIAS or CNAME records for `asios.tech` point to GitHub Pages as described by GitHub docs.

Notes:
- The feedback form uses a mailto: link because GitHub Pages does not support server-side form handling.
- Edit content freely and replace placeholder sections with product pages when ready.
