    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="muted">Effective date: November 27, 2025 — ASIOS LLC</div>

    <p><strong>ASIOS LLC</strong> ("we", "our", "us") cares about your privacy. This page explains our policies with respect to the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of Personal Information in connection with our websites and mobile applications (collectively, the "Software" or "Services").</p>

    <h2>Scope & Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By using our Software you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Software or the Services.</p>

    <h2>What information we may collect</h2>
    <p>Depending on how you use our Software, we may collect some or all of the following categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Device identifiers, advertising IDs, user IDs, account names.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Email address, phone number, postal address (if provided).</li>
      <li><strong>App content & media:</strong> Photos or other media you upload when using features that process images (see "Photo Processing").</li>
      <li><strong>Usage & analytics:</strong> Pages/screens viewed, features used, timestamps, session length, performance metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics / Log Data:</strong> Crash logs, error reports, IP address, device model, OS version, app configuration and other technical data automatically collected when using the Software.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment & billing:</strong> Billing and payment information if you purchase paid features (payment processors may collect and store payment credentials separately).</li>
      <li><strong>Other information:</strong> Any information you voluntarily provide via forms, feedback, support tickets, or correspondence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use (app reference)</h2>
    <p>This Software may be provided "as is" and is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information. If you choose to use our Software, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Software. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>How we collect information</h2>
    <p>We collect information in three primary ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Directly from you:</strong> When you create an account, contact support, submit feedback, or otherwise provide data.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically:</strong> Through cookies, SDKs, and other tracking technologies embedded in the Software that gather usage, performance, and diagnostic data.</li>
      <li><strong>From third parties:</strong> When you connect third-party services or when service integrations supply data to enable functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-party services and SDKs</h2>
    <p>Our Software may use third-party services and libraries that collect data to operate, improve, and monetize the Software. These may include (but are not limited to):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple (App Store delivery, in-app purchases, and related services)</li>
      <li>Google Play Services and related Google platforms</li>
      <li>Analytics & crash reporting (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase)</li>
      <li>Advertising platforms (e.g., AdMob or similar ad networks)</li>
      <li>AI providers for photo or content processing (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, or other trusted AI providers)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Links to third-party privacy policies are available on their respective sites; we recommend reviewing them. Third parties only receive the minimum data required to perform their services.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>When you use our Software, we may collect Log Data — technical information recorded by our Software or by third-party SDKs, such as IP address, device type, operating system version, app configuration, timestamps, and other diagnostic or performance information used to monitor and improve the Services.</p>

    <h2>Cookies & similar technologies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small files placed on your device. Our Software does not directly write browser cookies for native mobile apps, but third-party SDKs and web components (embedded webviews) may use cookies or similar local storage mechanisms to provide their services. You can usually manage tracking preferences in your device or browser settings; disabling some cookies or analytics may impact features of the Software.</p>

    <h2>Service providers</h2>
    <p>We may engage third parties to facilitate the Software, perform related services, or assist in analyzing usage. These parties have access to personal information only as necessary to perform their functions and are contractually bound not to disclose or use the information for other purposes.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect personal information in transit and at rest (including encryption where appropriate). However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security; please take care when transmitting sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>Screen recording data</h2>
    <p>Our application does not collect, use, disclose, share, or retain any screen recording data produced by the user. Any screen recordings initiated or saved by the user are stored locally on the user’s device and are not transmitted to us unless you explicitly choose to share them.</p>

    <h2>Face detection</h2>
    <p>If a feature uses face detection (for example, to detect the presence of a human face before enabling an image filter), face detection is performed locally on the device and we do not collect, store, or transmit facial biometric templates. Face detection is used only to enable features and not for identification or profiling.</p>

    <h2>Photo processing & AI features</h2>
    <p>Some features may send user-selected photos or inputs to our secure servers for temporary processing, and—where necessary—to trusted third-party AI providers (for example, OpenAI or Google Gemini) to generate requested effects or transformations. When we do so:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The photo or input is transmitted over secure channels for processing and is used solely to fulfill the requested operation.</li>
      <li>Photos and inputs sent for processing are not used to train third-party providers unless explicitly disclosed and agreed to by you.</li>
      <li>We retain processed content only as necessary for service delivery, debugging, or as required by law; otherwise temporary copies are removed promptly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a particular app feature processes media purely on device, that feature will be called out in the app description and no photo data leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Links to other sites</h2>
    <p>The Software may include links to third-party sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. Review privacy policies of any third party you interact with.</p>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Software is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you learn a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, contact us and we will delete that information.</p>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to provide, maintain, and improve the Software, process transactions, support users, analyze usage, and comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Services, fulfill the purposes described here, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.</p>

    <h2>GDPR — EU/EEA/UK residents</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the EU, EEA, or UK, you have rights including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection, and rights regarding automated decision-making. To exercise these rights, contact <strong><a href="mailto:ed@asios.tech">ed@asios.tech</a></strong>.</p>

    <h2>CCPA — California residents</h2>
    <p>California residents may have rights under the CCPA such as the right to know, access, delete, and opt out of certain processing. To exercise rights, contact <strong><a href="mailto:ed@asios.tech">ed@asios.tech</a></strong>.</p>

    <h2>How to access, update, or delete your data</h2>
    <p>To review, update, export, or request deletion of your personal information, contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:ed@asios.tech">ed@asios.tech</a></strong> or use account settings where available. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically. If material changes occur, we will notify you via the Software or email and update the "Effective date" above. You are encouraged to review this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>App Store & Play Store disclosures</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy covers apps distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play. When submitting apps, we will provide required disclosures in App Store Connect and Google Play Console consistent with this policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact & Data Controller</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or wish to exercise your privacy rights, contact our Data Protection Officer at:</p>
